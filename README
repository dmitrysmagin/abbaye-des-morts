INTRODUCTION

Abbaye des Morts is a freeware game made by LocoMalito (with the help of Gryzor87 in music side) in 2010. This game is, like other Locomalito's game, developed with Gamemaker and only runs natively in Microsoft Windows systems.

This is a port of this game to GNU/Linux systems. Is written in C code with the help of SDL libraries.

The code is licensed under GNU GPL version 3, so anyone can download, see, change and redistributed the code.


INSTALLATION FROM SOURCE

To compile the program you need GCC compiler and SDL libraries. In Fedora systems you can install all of this packages with this command (as root):

$ yum install gcc SDL-devel SDL_mixer-devel SDL_image-devel SDL_ttf-devel SDL_gfx-devel

For Ubuntu users, run this:

$ sudo apt-get install gcc libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-dev

Unpack the source code file:

$ tar vxfz abbaye_linux_beta.tar.gz

Enter the directory created an run:

$ make abbaye

As root, install the game with:

$ make install

(Ubuntu users run: $ sudo make install)

A icon will appear in your application menu, in game section. Alternatively you can run the game with the order "abbaye".


UNINSTALLATION FROM SOURCE

Enter the directory and run (as root):

$ make uninstall (Ubuntu users run: $ sudo make uninstall).


OPENPANDORA VERSION INSTALLATION

Just download the .pnd file (for example abbaye-1.0.pnd) and put it in the "pandora/menu", "pandora/desktop" or "pandora/apps" directory of your OpenPandora SD card. The game icon should appear in the applications menu (under Games/Adventure and RPG) and/or in the desktop (depending on where you put the .pnd file). Launch the game as usual and enjoy!


BUILDING OPENPANDORA VERSION

The easiest way to build this version is just by using the C/C++/Py Development Tools package. Get it here: http://repo.openpandora.org/?page=detail&app=cdevtools.freamon.40n8e
Once installed, launch it, change the directory to the one you use for building stuff, make sure your OpenPandora console is connected to the Internet and run the following commands:

svn checkout http://abbaye-for-linux.googlecode.com/svn/ abbaye-for-linux-read-only
cd abbaye-for-linux-read-only
make abbaye-pandora

And that's all. You can test the built binary launching ./abbaye-pandora. It will most likely run inside a window at 320x240 resolution. To make it fullscreen, create a script to launch it, with the following contents:
_______________________

#!/bin/sh
export SDL_VIDEODRIVER="omapdss"
export SDL_OMAP_VSYNC="0"
export SDL_OMAP_LAYER_SIZE="640x480"
./abbaye-pandora
_______________________

Make sure the script has exec permissions, launch it, and you should be able to play the game fullscreen. Finally, it's recommended to package the game in a .pnd file, but doing it is beyond the scope of this readme file.
